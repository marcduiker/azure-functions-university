      "description": "The goal of this lesson is to show how to call third-party REST APIs from your functions using dependency injection and Refit, a type-safe REST library.\r\n\r\nCalling REST APIs usually involves the well-known [HttpClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient?view=net-6.0) .NET class. However, using this class effectively has always been a challenge as it is designed to be instantiated once and reused troughout the life of your application.\r\n\r\nStarting from .NET Core 2.1, the BCL [introduced a set of changes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/implement-resilient-applications/use-httpclientfactory-to-implement-resilient-http-requests) designed to make `HttpClient` easier to use in a correct and efficient manner."

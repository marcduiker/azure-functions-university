We assume that you have already made your way through the [first lesson](../chaining/README.md) on Azure Durable Functions to have an understanding of the basics. If not we highly recommend to do so before starting with this lesson.

## 1. Scenario

Throughout this lesson we will focus on the _scenario_ of employee onboarding. The storyline is to automate the workflow that lies behind the onboarding of a new employee at a company. Let us assume that whenever a new employee is onboarded the following steps need to be executed in different backend systems:

- Trigger the creation of an access card to the company building
- Start the purchasing process for the IT equipment of the employee based on the role  
- Send out an email with a welcoming text to the new employee and some guidance how the start day will look like.

As we already know we can model a sequence of these steps making use of Azure Durable Functions, so it would be possible to execute one step after the other. But these steps do not have any dependency on each other, so there is no need to wait for the outcome of the access card creation to start the purchasing process. From a business process perspective we could kick off all activities in parallel and then wait until all activities have finished to successfully close this part of the onboarding process.

Let's find out how to do this with Azure Durable Functions.

> 🔎 **Observation** - The goal of this lesson is to learn about patterns that can be applied using Azure Durable Functions. We will therefore "simulate" the onboarding steps and not call any other external systems as we would in reality. We have shown this including patterns for resilience of the calls to external systems in the  [first lesson](../chaining/README.md) on Azure Durable Functions.

## 2. Fan-Out/Fan-In

In this section we explore how to execute the onboarding activities in parallel. This pattern is called _Fan-Out/Fan-In_ as we first fan-out the execution of several activities in parallel and then wait until all activities have finished to fan-in again and continue with the process.

We design the solution as follows:

- as an entry point for the process we use a `Durable Functions HTTP Starter` Function that receives a `POST` request containing the data of the new employee (name, email, start date, role).
- the orchestration i.e. the parallel execution of the onboarding activities is done via a `Durable Functions Orchestrator`.
- the single steps of the onboarding are defined in `Durable Functions Activities`.

We achieve the parallel execution of the tasks via the `Tasks.all` method available on the Durable Functions context object. This method expects an array of activity calls as input.

We assume that the input data provided from the caller has the following form:

```json
{
   "name": "Johnny Lawrence",
   "email": "johnny.lawrence@eaglefang.com",
   "startdate": "01.02.2022",
   "role": "developer"
}  
```

### Basic Setup

#### Steps

1. Create a directory for our Function App and navigate into the directory:

   ```powershell
   mkdir OnbordingByDurableFunction
   cd OnbordingByDurableFunction
   ```

2. Start Visual Studio Code:

   ```powershell
   code .
   ```

3. Create a new project via the Azure Functions Extension:
    - Name the project `OnbordingByDurableFunction`.
    - Choose `TypeScript` as language.
    - Select `Durable Functions HTTP Starter` as a template as we want to trigger the execution of the Durable Function via an HTTP call.
    - Name the Function `OnboardingStarter`.
    - Set the authorization level of the Function to `Anonymous`.

4. Install the `durable-functions` package via npm `npm install durable-functions`.

   > 📝 **Tip** - Additionally install the `@types/node` npm package as a dev-dependency because this is needed for the build process.

5. Adjust the `function.json` file of the Durable Functions Client `OnboardingStarter` to expose only an `POST` endpoint:

   ```json
    "methods": [
      "post"
    ]
   ```

6. Create a new Orchestrator Function via the Azure Functions Extension in VSCode.
    - Select `Durable Functions orchestrator` as a template.
    - Name the Function `OnboardingOrchestrator`.

      > 📝 **Tip** - We will adjust the code of the Orchestrator Function after we have created the Activity Functions that we want to execute.

7. Create three new Activity Functions via the Azure Functions Extension in VSCode.
    - Select `Durable Functions activity` as a template.
    - Name the Functions `AccessCardCreationActivity`, `ItEquipmentOrderActivity`, `WelcomeEmailActivity`.

8. Set the `AzureWebJobsStorage` parameter in the `local.settings.json` to `UseDevelopmentStorage=true`:

   ```json
   {
    "IsEncrypted": false,
    "Values": {
       "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
       "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node"
     }
   }
   ```

### Implementation of the Orchestrator Function

As the basic setup is in place we now implement the fan-out/fan-in pattern in the Orchestrator Function.  

#### Steps

1. Open the `index.ts` file of the Orchestrator Function and remove the comments.
2. Remove the content of the function's body. It should look like this:

   ```typescript
   import * as df from "durable-functions"

   const orchestrator = df.orchestrator(function* (context) {

   })

   export default orchestrator
   ```

3. Define an empty array called `onboardingTasks` that will be filled with the Activity Functions that should be executed in parallel:
  
   ```typescript
   const onboardingTasks = [] 
   ```

4. Push the call of the onboarding Activity Functions that we defined before into the array. Hand over the input data available via the `context` object to the Activity Functions:

   ```typescript
   onboardingTasks.push(context.df.callActivity("AccessCardCreationActivity", context.bindingData.input))
   onboardingTasks.push(context.df.callActivity("ItEquipmentOrderActivity", context.bindingData.input))
   onboardingTasks.push(context.df.callActivity("WelcomeEmailActivity", context.bindingData.input))  
   ```

   > 🔎 **Observation** - Comparing this call of Activity Functions with the one of the chaining we see that the call itself remains the same, but we omit the key word `yield` and therefore do not trigger the generator functionality used in the chaining scenario.

   > 📝 **Tip** - You can also make use of the retry functionality available on the `context.df` object to call the Activity Function.

5. Start the parallel execution of the Activity Functions via `Task.all`, fetch the result data and return it:

   ```typescript
    const result = yield context.df.Task.all(onboardingTasks)

    return result
   ```

   > 🔎 **Observation** - In contrast to the single Activity Function calls, we yielded the overall task execution. We get back a task that won't complete until all activities have completed. This is the same concept as `Promise.all` in JavaScript. The difference is that the tasks could be running on multiple virtual machines concurrently, and the Durable Functions extension ensures that the end-to-end execution is resilient to process recycling.

### Implementation of the Activity Functions

Next we implement the three Activity Function we triggered via the Orchestrator Function. As described above we will only mimic the different process steps and not execute real calls of backend services.

#### Steps

1. Go to the directory that contains the Activity Function `AccessCardCreationActivity`.

    - Open the `function.json` file and change the name of the input binding to `input`:

      ```json
      "bindings": [
       {
         "name": "input",
         "type": "activityTrigger",
         "direction": "in"
       }
      ```

    - Open the `index.ts` file and remove all comments and the content of the functions's body. The result should look like this:

      ```typescript
      import { AzureFunction, Context } from "@azure/functions"
      
      const activityFunction: AzureFunction = async function (context: Context): Promise<string> {
      
      }
      
      export default activityFunction
      
      ```

    - Insert a log message that the access card was created and return a corresponding message to the Orchestrator Function. Use the information that is available via the input binding to personalize the message. A result could look like this:

      ```typescript
      const activityFunction: AzureFunction = async function (context: Context): Promise<string> {
      
          const message = `Access card created for ${context.bindings.input.name} starting on ${context.bindings.input.startdate}`
      
          context.log(message)
      
          return message

      }
      ```

2. Go to the directory that contains the Activity Function `ItEquipmentOrderActivity`.

    - Open the `function.json` file and change the name of the input binding to `input`:

      ```json
      "bindings": [
       {
         "name": "input",
         "type": "activityTrigger",
         "direction": "in"
       }
      ```

    - Open the `index.ts` file and remove all comments and the content of the functions's body. The result should look like this:
  
      ```typescript
      import { AzureFunction, Context } from "@azure/functions"
      
      const activityFunction: AzureFunction = async function (context: Context): Promise<string> {
      
      }
      
      export default activityFunction
      ```
  
    - Insert a log message that the role-specific IT equipment was ordered and return a corresponding message to the Orchestrator Function. Use the information that is available via the input binding to personalize the message. A result could look like this:
  
      ```typescript
      const activityFunction: AzureFunction = async function (context: Context): Promise<string> {
      
          const message = `Role specific IT equipment (role: ${context.bindings.input.role}) was ordered for ${context.bindings.input.name} starting on ${context.bindings.input.startdate}`
      
          context.log(message)
      
          return message

      }
      ```

3. Go to the directory that contains the Activity Function `WelcomeEmailActivity`.

    - Open the `function.json` file and change the name of the input binding to `input`:
  
      ```json
      "bindings": [
       {
         "name": "input",
         "type": "activityTrigger",
         "direction": "in"
       }
      ```
  
    - Open the `index.ts` file and remove all comments and the content of the functions's body. The result should look like this:

      ```typescript
      import { AzureFunction, Context } from "@azure/functions"
      
      const activityFunction: AzureFunction = async function (context: Context): Promise<string> {
      
      }
      
      export default activityFunction
      ```
  
    - Insert a log message that a welcome email was sent and return a corresponding message to the Orchestrator Function. Use the information that is available via the input binding to personalize the message. A result could look like this:
  
      ```typescript
      const activityFunction: AzureFunction = async function (context: Context): Promise<string> {
      
          const message = `Welcome ${context.bindings.input.name}! Happy to have you on board and see you on ${context.bindings.input.startdate}!`
      
          context.log(message)
      
          return message
      
      }
      ```

4. Install the dependencies defined in the `package.json` via `npm install` in a shell of your choice.
5. Build the project by making use of the predefined script in the `package.json` file via `npm run build` in a shell of your choice.
6. Start the Azure Storage Emulator _Azurite_.
7. Start the Azure Functions via `npm run start`.

   ![Durable Function Parallel Execution Start](img/ParallelExecutionStart.png)

   >🔎 **Observation** - You can see that the runtime is serving the different types of Azure Functions.

8. Call the Client Function via the tool of your choice e.g. the RESTClient extension of VSCode.

   ```rest
   POST http://localhost:7071/api/orchestrators/OnboardingOrchestrator
   content-type: application/json
   
   {
       "name": "Johnny Lawrence",
       "email": "johnny.lawrence@eaglefang.com",
       "startdate": "01.02.2022",
       "role": "developer"
   }   
   ```

9. The Durable Functions do not directly return the result of the parallel execution. We need to call the `statusQueryGetUri` endpoint to receive the results:

   ![Durable Function Parallel Execution Result](img/ParallelExecutionResult.png)

10. Check the resulting entries in your Azure Storage Explorer.

     > ❔ **Question** - What is different with regards to the execution sequence when comparing the parallel and the sequential one?

## 3. Sub-Orchestration

In this section we introduce the concept of *sub-orchestration*. Sub-orchestration uses the capability of Orchestrator Functions to call _other_ Orchestrator Functions. This enables us to create larger orchestrations by _combining_ Orchestrator Functions as building blocks or to run _multiple instances_ of Orchestrator Functions in _parallel_.

Transferring this to our onboarding scenario, we will now onboard several new employees in parallel. We create one new Orchestrator Function that calls the existing Orchestrator Function based on an array of new employees.
### Steps

1. Create a new Orchestrator Function called `ParallelOnboardingOrchestrator` using the VSCode extension.
2. Open the `index.ts` file of the new Orchestrator Functions and remove the content of the functions's body:

   ```typescript
   import * as df from "durable-functions"
   
   const orchestrator = df.orchestrator(function* (context) {
   
   })
   
   export default orchestrator
   ```

3. We assume that we get a JSON array as input via the `context` parameter. The input has the following structure:

   ```json
   {
       "employees2onboard": [
           {
               "name": "Johnny Lawrence",
               "email": "johnny.lawrence@eaglefang.com",
               "startdate": "01.02.2022",
               "role": "developer"
           },
           {
               "name": "Daniel LaRusso",
               "email": "daniel.larusso@miyagido.com",
               "startdate": "15.02.2022",
               "role": "sales"
           },
           {
               "name": "Terry Silver",
               "email": "terry.silver@cobrakai.com",
               "startdate": "01.03.2022",
               "role": "manager"
           }
       ]
   }   
   ```

4. The first building block of the new Orchestrator Function is to iterate over the input array. In case that the input is empty we log a corresponding warning message:

   ```typescript
   const orchestrator = df.orchestrator(function* (context) {
   
       const employees2onboard = context.bindingData.input.employees2onboard
   
       if (employees2onboard) {
         
           for (const employeeEntry of employees2onboard) {
   
           }
           
   
       }
       else {
           context.log.warn("No employees to onboard")
       }
   
   })   
   ```

5. The mechanics is the same as in the prior case: we need an array where we push our `callSubOrchestrator` executions to. In addition we need an identifier for each sub-orchestration which we create manually by combining the Durable Functions Instance ID with the employee name from the list. After that we trigger the execution via `yield context.df.Task.all` on the array:

   ```typescript
   const orchestrator = df.orchestrator(function* (context) {
   
       const employees2onboard = context.bindingData.input.employees2onboard
   
       if (employees2onboard) {
   
           const onboardingList = []
   
           for (const employeeEntry of employees2onboard) {
   
               const childId = context.df.instanceId + `:${employeeEntry.name}`
               const onboardingListEntry = context.df.callSubOrchestrator("OnboardingOrchestrator", employeeEntry, childId)
   
               onboardingList.push(onboardingListEntry)
   
           }
      
           yield context.df.Task.all(onboardingList)
       }
       else {
           context.log.warn("No employees to onboard")
       }
   
   })   
   ```

   > 📝 **Tip** - Be aware that the sub-orchestrations must be defined in the same Function App as the parent orchestration.

6. We also add a log message telling us how many sub-orchestrations will be started. The Orchestrator Function finally looks like this:

   ```typescript
   import * as df from "durable-functions"
   
   const orchestrator = df.orchestrator(function* (context) {
   
       const employees2onboard = context.bindingData.input.employees2onboard
   
       if (employees2onboard) {
   
           const onboardingList = []
   
   
           for (const employeeEntry of employees2onboard) {
   
               const childId = context.df.instanceId + `:${employeeEntry.name}`
               const onboardingListEntry = context.df.callSubOrchestrator("OnboardingOrchestrator", employeeEntry, childId)
   
               onboardingList.push(onboardingListEntry)
   
           }
   
           if (context.df.isReplaying === false) {
               context.log.info(`Starting ${onboardingList.length} sub-orchestrations for update`)
           }
   
           yield context.df.Task.all(onboardingList)
       }
       else {
           context.log.warn("No employees to onboard")
       }
   
   })
   
   export default orchestrator
   ```

   > 🔎 **Observation** - we use the `isReplaying` attribute of the Durable Functions context to avoid multiple log entries after the yield is resumed.

7. Build the project by making use of the predefined script in the `package.json` file via `npm run build` in a shell of your choice.
8. If not already running, start the Azure Storage Emulator _Azurite_.
9. Start the Azure Functions via `npm run start`.

   >🔎 **Observation** - You can see that the runtime is serving the new Orchestrator Function.

10. Call the Client Function via the tool of your choice e.g. the RESTClient extension of VSCode. Make sure to call the new Orchestrator Function:
  
     ```rest
     POST http://localhost:7071/api/orchestrators/ParallelOnboardingOrchestrator
     content-type: application/json
     
     {
         "employees2onboard": [
             {
                 "name": "Johnny Lawrence",
                 "email": "johnny.lawrence@eaglefang.com",
                 "startdate": "01.02.2022",
                 "role": "developer"
             },
             {
                 "name": "Daniel LaRusso",
                 "email": "daniel.larusso@miyagido.com",
                 "startdate": "15.02.2022",
                 "role": "sales"
             },
             {
                 "name": "Terry Silver",
                 "email": "terry.silver@cobrakai.com",
                 "startdate": "01.03.2022",
                 "role": "manager"
             }
         ]
     }
     ```
  
11. Checking the `statusQueryGetUri` endpoint will this time only tell us the status of the execution. To see what happened we must take a look at the data in the Azure Storage Explorer.

     > ❔ **Question** - How many orchestration instances have been created?

     > ❔ **Question** - Can you distinguish between the main orchestration and the sub-orchestrations?

     > ❔ **Question** - What is the difference between the triggering of a sub-orchestration and an activity?

## 4. External Event - Human Interaction

In many workflow scenarios the process will probably need human interaction in some cases. Looking at our onboarding example one could think of that depending on the role a manual release is needed for the IT equipment order if the value exceeds a certain value and the role is e.g. "sales".

These escalation flows can be modeled via Durable Functions and _external events_. As in the case of sub-orchestrations the Durable Functions context provides a methods called `waitForExternalEvent`. This method allows us to react to external events including data transferred by the event.

In the following section we use this functionality to model the following process flow:

- We check if the role of a new employee is "sales" and mimic that the IT equipment exceeds a certain spending limit via a dedicated Activity Function.
- Depending on the outcome of the check we wait for an external event that releases the order. We set a timer to limit the waiting time.
- If the human interaction is executed, we trigger the order of the equipment.

### Steps

1. Create a new Activity Functions called `CheckItEquipmentValueByRoleActivity` using the Azure Functions extension of VSCode.
2. Open the `function.json` file and change the name of the input binding to `input`
3. The Activity Function checks the role of the new employee. If the role is "sales" it returns `approval needed`, otherwise it returns `approved`:

   ```typescript
    import { AzureFunction, Context } from "@azure/functions"
    
    const activityFunction: AzureFunction = async function (context: Context): Promise<string> {
    
        if (context.bindings.input.role === "sales"){
    
            return `approval needed`
    
        }
        else{
    
            return `approved`
    
        }
    
    }
    
    export default activityFunction
   ```

4. Create a new Orchestrator Function `OnboardingOrchestratorExternalEvent`, switch to the `index.ts` file  and remove the content of the function's body:

   ```typescript
   import * as df from "durable-functions"
   
   const orchestrator = df.orchestrator(function* (context) {
   
   })
   
   export default orchestrator
   ```

5. Implement the call of the new Activity Function to execute the check we just implemented:

   ```typescript
   const orchestrator = df.orchestrator(function* (context) {
   
       const checkResult = yield context.df.callActivity("CheckItEquipmentValueByRoleActivity", context.bindingData.input)
   
   })
   ```

6. Next implement the case where a manual approval is needed. For that we instruct the Azure Functions runtime to wait for an external event via the method `waitForExternalEvent`. We specify the event as `ApprovalRequest` and react depending on the result provided via the event:

   ```typescript
   const orchestrator = df.orchestrator(function* (context) {

       const checkResult = yield context.df.callActivity("CheckItEquipmentValueByRoleActivity", context.bindingData.input)
   
       let orderApproved = false
   
       if (checkResult !== "approved") {
   
           const approvalTask = yield context.df.waitForExternalEvent("ApprovalRequest")
      
   
           if (approvalTask.result === 'approved') {
               orderApproved = true
           }
           else {
               orderApproved = false
           }

       }
   
   })
   ```

   > 🔎 **Observation** - The object returned as external event has a parameter called `result` that contains the information provided by the caller of the event.

   > ❔ **Question** - What would happen if no event was raised by a caller?

7. We limit the time that we wait for the external event. For that we rewrite the logic, using the `Timer` functionality of Durable Functions that we used in the first lesson on Durable Functions as a circuit breaker. We wait for 90 seconds for the human interaction. The adjusted logic of the Orchestrator Function looks like this:

   ```typescript
   import * as df from "durable-functions"   
   import { DateTime } from "luxon"
   
   const orchestrator = df.orchestrator(function* (context) {
   
       const checkResult = yield context.df.callActivity("CheckItEquipmentValueByRoleActivity", context.bindingData.input)
   
       let orderApproved = false
   
       if (checkResult !== "approved") {
   
           const expiration = DateTime.fromJSDate(context.df.currentUtcDateTime, { zone: 'utc' }).plus({ seconds: 90 });
           const timeoutTask = context.df.createTimer(expiration.toJSDate())
   
           const approvalTask = context.df.waitForExternalEvent("ApprovalRequest")
   
           const winner = yield context.df.Task.any([approvalTask, timeoutTask])
   
           if (winner === approvalTask) {
   
               if (approvalTask.result === 'approved') {
                   orderApproved = true
               }
               else {
                   orderApproved = false
               }
   
           } else {
   
               context.log.warn("Timeout expired");
           }
   
           if (!timeoutTask.isCompleted) {
   
               timeoutTask.cancel()
   
           }
       }
   
   })
   ```

8. Last thing we need to add is the logic that reacts on the result of the check or the external event, namely to execute the order process or to inform about the decline of the order. We add the code at the end of the function's body:

   ```typescript
       if (checkResult === "approved" || orderApproved === true) {
           const orderResult = yield context.df.callActivity("ItEquipmentOrderActivity", context.bindingData.input)
   
           return orderResult
       }
       else {
           const message = "Order was declined"
   
           context.log.error(message)
   
           return message
   
       }
   ```

9. The code of the Orchestrator Function finally looks like this:

   ```typescript
   import * as df from "durable-functions"
   import { DateTime } from "luxon"
   
   const orchestrator = df.orchestrator(function* (context) {
   
       const checkResult = yield context.df.callActivity("CheckItEquipmentValueByRoleActivity", context.bindingData.input)
   
       let orderApproved = false
   
       if (checkResult !== "approved") {
   
           const expiration = DateTime.fromJSDate(context.df.currentUtcDateTime, { zone: 'utc' }).plus({ seconds: 90 });
           const timeoutTask = context.df.createTimer(expiration.toJSDate())
   
           const approvalTask = context.df.waitForExternalEvent("ApprovalRequest")
   
           const winner = yield context.df.Task.any([approvalTask, timeoutTask])
   
           if (winner === approvalTask) {
   
               if (approvalTask.result === 'approved') {
                   orderApproved = true
               }
               else {
                   orderApproved = false
               }
   
           } else {
   
               context.log.warn("Timeout expired");
           }
   
           if (!timeoutTask.isCompleted) {
   
               timeoutTask.cancel()
   
           }
       }
   
       if (checkResult === "approved" || orderApproved === true) {
           const orderResult = yield context.df.callActivity("ItEquipmentOrderActivity", context.bindingData.input)
   
           return orderResult
       }
       else {
           const message = "Order was declined"
   
           context.log.error(message)
   
           return message
   
       }
   
   })
   
   export default orchestrator
   ```

10. Install the new dependency via `npm install luxon` and then build the project by making use of the predefined script in the `package.json` file via `npm run build` in a shell of your choice.
11. If not already running, start the Azure Storage Emulator _Azurite_.
12. Start the Azure Functions via `npm run start`.
13. Make the call to trigger the human interaction i.e. the waiting for the external event:

     ```rest
     POST http://localhost:7071/api/orchestrators/OnboardingOrchestratorExternalEvent
     content-type: application/json
     
     {
         "name": "Daniel LaRusso",
         "email": "daniel.larusso@miyagido.com",
         "startdate": "15.02.2022",
         "role": "sales"
     }   
     ```

14. Trigger the event manually via a `POST` request. The correct URI is given by the `"sendEventPostUri"` of the response message of the previous `POST` request. Replace the placeholder `{eventName}` in the URI with `ApprovalRequest`. A sample request looks like this:

     ```rest
     POST http://localhost:7071/runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/d0f9580077c54397a53b336ea8a2799d/raiseEvent/ApprovalRequest?taskHub=TestHubName&connection=Storage&code=GKNGoT5Gp3ztIkQ05Lo3GY8gJry4jpiX8D8dhJiBA6GDuxyvnfziSA==
     content-type: application/json
     
      "approved"
     ```

     > ❔ **Question** - What do you see as processing sequence in the Azure Storage Explorer?

     > 📝 **Tip** - Try out the timeout functionality that we implemented, setting the duration to 30 seconds.

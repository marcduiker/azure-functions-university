# Cosmos DB Trigger & Bindings

## Goal 🎯

The goal of this lesson is to learn about how to trigger a function by adding a document to CosmosDB, how to use input and output bindings, the usage of Azure KeyVault and dependency injection in functions using CosmosDB.

This lessons consists of the following exercises:

|Nr|Exercise
|-|-
|1|Running the Azure CosmosDB Emulator
|2|Using the CosmosDB output binding
|3|Using the CosmosDB input binding
|4|Creating a CosmosDB Trigger function
|5|Using Azure KeyVault for storing the connection string
|6|Reusing the CosmosDB connection with dependency injection
|7|Deploying to Azure

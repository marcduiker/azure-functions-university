## Creating your local workspace üë©‚Äçüíª

We strongly suggest you create a new folder (local git repository) and use this Azure Functions University repository for reference only (for when you're stuck).

- Create a new folder to work in:

    ```PowerShell
    New-Item -Type Directory -Name azfuncuni
    cd .\azfuncuni\
    ```

- Turn this into a git repository:

    ```PowerShell
    git init
    ```

- Add subfolders for the source code and test files:

    ```PowerShell
    New-Item -Type Directory -Name src
    New-Item -Type Directory -Name tst
    ```

You should be good to go now!

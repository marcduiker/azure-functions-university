## 1. Creating a Function App

In this exercise, you'll be creating a Function App with the default HTTPTrigger and review the generated code.

### Steps

1. In VSCode, create the Function App by running `AzureFunctions: Create New Project` in the Command Palette (CTRL+SHIFT+P).
2. Browse to the location where you want to save the function app (e.g. _AzureFunctions.Http_).

    > 📝 **Tip** - Create a folder with a descriptive name since that will be used as the name for the project.

3. Select the language you'll be using to code the function, in this lesson we'll be using `C#`.
4. Select `HTTPTrigger` as the template.
5. Give the function a name (e.g. `HelloWorldHttpTrigger`).
6. Enter a namespace for the function (e.g. `AzureFunctionsUniversity.Demo`).
    > 📝 **Tip** - Namespaces are used to organize pieces of code into a hierarchy. Make sure you don't use the exact same name as the function/class. Namespaces and classes should be named uniquely to prevent compiler and readability issues.
7. Select `Function` for the AccessRights.
    > 🔎 **Observation** - Now a new Azure Functions project is being generated. Once it's done, look at the files in the project. You will see the following:

    |File|Description
    |-|-
    |AzureFunctions.Http.csproj|The C# project file which specifies the .NET version, Azure Functions version and package references.
    |HelloWorldHttpTrigger.cs|The C# class containing the HTTPTrigger function method.
    |host.json|Contains [global configuration options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-host-json) for all the functions in a function app.
    |local.settings.json|Contains [app settings and connectionstrings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-host-json) for local development.

    > ❔ **Question** - Review the generated HTTPTrigger function. What is it doing?
8. Build the project (CTRL+SHIFT+B).

9. Start the Function App by pressing `F5`.
    > 🔎 **Observation** - Eventually you should see an HTTP endpoint in the output.
10. Now call the function by making a GET request to the above endpoint using a REST client:

    ```http
    GET http://localhost:7071/api/HelloWorldHttpTrigger?name=YourName
    ```

    > ❔ **Question** - What is the result of the function? Is it what you expected?

    > ❔ **Question** - What happens when you don't supply a value for the name?

## 2. Changing the template for GET requests

Let's change the template to find out what parameters can be changed.
Depending on the trigger, arguments can be added/removed and parameter types can be changed.
Start with only allowing GET requests.

### Steps

1. Remove the `"post"` string from the `HttpTrigger` attribute. Now the function can only be triggered by a GET request.
    > 📝 **Tip** - Some people don't like to use strings and prefer something that is known as _strong typing_. Strong typing can prevent you from making certain mistakes such as typos in strings since specific .NET types are used instead. To allow the function to be triggered by a GET request replace the `"get"` string with `nameof(HttpMethods.Get)`. Now you're using a strongly typed version of the HTTP GET verb instead of a string reference.
2. The `req` parameter type can also be changed. Try changing it from  `HttpRequest` to `HttpRequestMessage`. This requires a using of `System.Net.Http`.

    > 🔎 **Observation** - You'll notice that this change breaks the code inside the function. This is because the `HttpRequestMessage` type has different properties and methods than the `HttpRequest` type.
3. Remove the content of the function method (but keep the method definition). We'll be writing a new implementation.
4. Remove the `async Task` part of the method definition since the method is not asynchronous anymore. The method should look like this now:

    ```csharp
    public static IActionResult Run(...)
    ```

5. To get the name from the query string you can do the following:

    ```csharp
    var collection = req.RequestUri.ParseQueryString();
    string name = collection["name"];
    ```

    > 🔎 **Observation** - In the generated template the response was always an `OkResultObject`. This means that when a clients calls the function, an HTTP status 200, is always returned. Let's make the function a bit smarter and return a `BadRequestObjectResult` (HTTP status 400).
6. Add an `if` statement to the function that checks if the name value is `null`. If the name is `null` return a `BadRequestObjectResult`, otherwise return a `OkResultObject`.

    ```csharp
    ObjectResult result;
    if(string.IsNullOrEmpty(name))
    {
        var responseMessage = "Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.";
        result = new BadRequestObjectResult(responseMessage);
    }
    else
    {
        var responseMessage = $"Hello, {name}. This HTTP triggered function executed successfully.";
        result = new OkObjectResult(responseMessage);
    }

    return result;
    ```

    Now the function has proper return values for both correct and incorrect invocations.

7. Run the function, once without name value in the querystring, and once with a name value.

    > ❔ **Question** - Is the outcome of both runs as expected?

## 3. Changing the template for POST requests

Let's change the function to also allow POST requests and test it by posting a request with JSON content in the body.

### Steps

1. Add a new C# class file named `Person.cs` to the project.
2. Make sure the content of the file looks like this (adjust the namespace so it matches yours):

    ```csharp
    namespace AzureFunctionsUniversity.Demo
    {
        public class Person
        {
            public string Name { get; set; }
        }
    }
    ```

3. Update the `HttpTrigger` attribute of the function to include the POST HTTP verb. You can choose to add the verb via the strongly typed way by adding `nameof(HttpMethods.Post)` or use the `"post"` string.
4. The function method now only handles GET requests. We need to add some logic to use the querystring for GET requests and use the request body for POST requests. This can be done by checking the Method property of the request (if the request type is `HttpRequestMessage`) as follows:

    ```csharp
    string name = default;
    if (req.Method.Method == HttpMethods.Get)
    {
        // Get name from querystring
        // name = ...
    }
    else if (req.Method.Method == HttpMethods.Post)
    {
        // Get name from body
        // name = ...
    }
    ```

5. Move the querystring logic inside the `if` statement that handles the GET request.
6. Now let's add the code to extract the name from the body for a POST request. 

    > 📝 **Tip** - When the request type is `HttpRequestMessage` there's a very nice method available on the Content property called `ReadAsAsync<T>`. This method returns a typed object from the request content. In our case we can return a `Person` object from the request as follows:

    ```csharp
    var person = await req.Content.ReadAsAsync<Person>();
    name = person.Name;
    ```

7. Change the method definition back to its asynchronous form since we're using async methods again:

    ```csharp
    public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(...)
    ```

8. Now run the function and do a POST request and submit JSON content with a `Name` property. If you're using the VSCode REST client you can use this in a .http file:

    ```http
    POST http://localhost:7071/api/HelloWorldHttpTrigger
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "name": "Your name"
    }
    ```

    > ❔ **Question** - Is the outcome of the POST as expected?

    > ❔ **Question** - What is the response when you use an empty `name` property?

## 4. Adding a new function for POST requests

Instead of using the `HttpRequest` or `HttpRequestMessage` type for the `req` parameter a custom .NET type can be used as the parameter type, in this case `Person`. This is only useful when working solely with the request body and not the querystring, since the HttpRequest object will be unavailable. Let's add a new function to the existing class file which only responds to POST requests.

### Steps

1. Copy & paste the function method from the exercise above and give this method a new name in the `FunctionName` attribute.

    > 📝 **Tip** - Function names need to be unique within a Function App.
2. Remove the GET verb from the `HttpTrigger` attribute since this function will only be triggered by POST requests.
3. Change the `HttpRequestMessage` type to `Person` and rename the `req` parameter to `person`. The HttpTrigger attribute should look like this:

    ```csharp
    [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, nameof(HttpMethods.Post), Route = null)]Person person,
    ```

4. Remove the logic inside the function which deals GET Http verb and with the querystring.
5. Update the logic which checks if the `name` variable is empty. You can now use `person.Name` instead.
6. Run the Function App.
    > 🔎 **Observation** You should see two HTTP endpoints in the output of the console.

7. Trigger the new endpoint by making a POST request.

    > ❔ **Question** Is the outcome as expected?

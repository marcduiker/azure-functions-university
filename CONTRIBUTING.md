# How to contribute

üëã Hi! Great that you want to contribute to Azure Functions University! üòÉ

We're currently focussed on creating beginner content for Azure Functions written in C#, TypeScript, Python, and PowerShell, and using VSCode as the code editor.

## Step 1 - GitHub Issues

üîé Please check if there's an [existing issue](https://github.com/marcduiker/azure-functions-university/issues) which matches your idea. Perhaps you can collaborate with someone on this.

üí° If you have  new idea, please [create a new __Content Request__ issue](https://github.com/marcduiker/azure-functions-university/issues/new?assignees=&labels=content&template=content_request.md&title=Content+Request%3A+%3CTITLE%3E) first where you can describe the topic.

## Step 2 - Process

Once we've discussed the Content Request issue and agree to include the lesson, you can start by forking the [Azure Functions University repository](https://github.com/marcduiker/azure-functions-university) and create a new branch for the topic and language you want to add (e.g. `cosmosdb-dotnet`).

Once you've created the lesson, submit a PR with the lesson, source code, and related files as mentioned in the next section. It will probably take a few iterations to get everything right, don't feel discouraged by this process ‚ô•.

### Lesson Structure

If you are contributing to create a lesson, please take into account the length and the tone of the existing lessons. We want to have a uniform experience across all of our lessons.

An Azure Functions University lesson consists of several parts:

- A lesson markdown file named `{topic}-{language}.md` in the `lessons/{language}/{topic}` folder. Example: _lessons/dotnet/http/http-dotnet.md_.
  - Use the [lesson template file](lessons/_lesson_template.md).
  - Give the lesson a short but descriptive title.
  - Describe the goal of the lesson.
  - Break up the lesson in small exercises.
  - Each exercise has a clear sub goal and steps how to achieve that sub goal.
  - Use code samples and plenty of üìù, üîé and ‚ùî call-outs.
  - Use gender-neutral language and avoid words such as 'easy' or 'simple'.
- A new Functions project to the `src/{language}/AzureFunctions.{Topic}` folder with a completely working and running example. E.g. _src/dotnet/AzureFunctions.Http_.
- [CodeTour](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour) files (one per exercise) to the `tours./{language}/{topic}/.tours` folder.
- A [VSCode workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_workspace-file-schema) file in the `workspace/{language}` folder for the lesson. The workspace should contain these folders:
  - `lessons/{language}/prerequisites`
  - `lessons/{language}/{topic}`
  - `src/{language}/AzureFunctions.{Topic}`
  - `test/{language}/{topic}` (REST Client files, if applicable)
  - `.tours/{language}/{topic}` (CodeTour files, if applicable)

Yes, this is a long list, but you don't have to do everything by yourself, we can work together on this! üí™
